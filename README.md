## Abstract

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating autoimmune disease that targets mature oligodendrocytes (MOLs) and their myelin. MOLs are transcriptionally heterogeneous and can transition to immune-like states in the context of MS. However, the intricacies of their dynamics throughout disease progression remain poorly understood. Here, we employed simultaneous single-cell multiome ATAC and RNA sequencing targeting oligodendroglia (OLGs) from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS mouse model at different stages of the disease course. We found that the transition to immune OLG states appear already at the early stages of EAE and persist to the late stages of the disease, consistent with epigenetic memory of previous neuroinflammation. Interestingly, transcription factor activity suggested immunosuppression in MOLs at early stages of EAE and we also observed a transitory regenerative cholesterol-associated program in MOLs at this stage. Importantly, different MOLs exhibit a differential responsiveness to EAE, with MOL2 exhibiting a stronger transcriptional immune response than MOL5/6. Moreover, we observed divergent responses at the epigenetic level of MOL2 and MOL5/6 during disease evolution. Thus, our single-cell multiomic resource highlights dynamic and distinct responses of OLG subpopulations to the evolving environment in EAE, which might modulate their response to regenerative therapeutic interventions in MS. 

## Raw data processing

A total of 7 batches were collected from the sequencing facility. Fastq files from 28 samples were processed throughout the 10X genomics standard pipeline. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility libraries were inputted into cellranger-arc2 ‘count’ v2.0.2 with default settings to align the biological readouts on the associated mm10 reference genome v2020-A-2.0.0. Sample aggregation of both transcriptomic and genomics metrics was done using the ‘aggr’ of the same Cellranger executable file, without normalization.
